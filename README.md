# Welcome to Version 2!

After failing to get our printer running for Infill (Hackclub 3d printing event), me and my work partner were kinda bummed out.
Luckily, we were given a second chance at Highway (With Alex Ren's permission)! So here we are with a LARGE overhaul of the old design, to our height improved, absent of design
oversights variation of Voltcore: The battery-powered 3d printer.

Enjoy!

NOTES: JOURNAL.md is a file required by Highway's submission policy (I believe it is used for metadata). Actual logging/journaling contents are located in the file 'CAPTAINSLOG.md'. Metadata, for reassurance, has also been stored in the 'CAPTAINSLOG.md' file.

FULL CAD ASSEMBLY OF THE DEVICE IS LOCATED HERE: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qafy4_DIeeeHwEZUQUGFcUI5MaNEcI4D/view?usp=sharing)

File titled 'VoltCore Buck Converter v7_2025-06-10.zip' is a collection of every file for the voltage regulator.

File titled 'bom_voltcorev2.csv' is a downloadable list containing the parts needed in this project. (Bill of materials)

File titled 'bom_voltcorev1.csv' is an archived list containing the parts needed for version 1 of this project. (Outdated bill of materials)
