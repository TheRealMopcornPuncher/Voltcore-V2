# Welcome to Version 2!

After failing to get our printer running for Infill (Hackclub 3d printing event), me and my work partner were kinda bummed out.
Luckily, we were given a second chance at Highway (With Alex Ren's permission)! So here we are with a LARGE overhaul of the old design, to our height improved, absent of design
oversights variation of Voltcore: The battery-powered 3d printer.

Enjoy!
